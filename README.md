Project Aleph-0

My first project :)
Its function is to be a tool for solving basic, generally mathematical problems such as equations.

For now it's being done in a terminal, but I intend to recreate it in a GUI with explanations of the solution to the problem so as not only to show the answer, but also to teach how the solution works.

Functions done:
- Drawing random numbers
- Potentiation
- First and second degree equations
- Average speed calculation (partially)

What I want to do:
- Conversion of measures
(No ideas yet)

Requirements:

- Python 3
- Windows
  
(Imprecise requirements because is not tested in other machines)
